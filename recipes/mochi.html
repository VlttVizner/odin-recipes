    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko). They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Red bean paste (also called adzuki bean paste or anko)</li>
        <li>Glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>Green tea powder (or matcha)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Plain granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Wrap red bean paste in foil and freeze until solid. Once the paste is frozen, divide and roll into eight equal balls. Set aside or return to the freezer.</li>
        <li>Mix sweet rice flour and green tea powder in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in water, then stir in the sugar. Mix until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and cook in the microwave for about 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Stir the mixture, then heat in the microwave for an additional 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Dust your work surface with cornstarch. Roll the (still hot) dough into balls. Flatten each ball and place one frozen red bean paste ball in the center. Pinch the mochi over the paste until covered. Sprinkle with more cornstarch and place the mochi (seam side down) in a paper muffin liner. Repeat the steps until all the dough and frozen paste is used.</li>

    </ol>
