This project is about making a website with recipes.
So far I have used HTML to make a main page and 4 other pages, each with a different recipe. 
To do so i used <ol> (ordered) and <ul> (unordered) lists, <img> for images with src and alt atributes, <h1> and <h2> to make headers, <p> to make a paragraph, <a> for related links.
